    question: "Question 3: How many sessions can I have with mentor?",
    answer: `
      <p>Great question. Before we answer this question, we would like to tell you that Long-term mentorship is not just about sessions. Long-term Mentorship ‚â† Sessions. A bulk of the magic happens outside sessions. Sessions are just one of the interactions that you can have with mentors.</p>
      <p>Coming to the question</p>
      <br>
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
        <li>On average we see mentors interact via 4-8 sessions, regular tasks, daily chats, follow-ups and even instant calls.</li>
        <li>A rough estimate of sessions & total interactions is available on the side panel, below the pricing. And also in the ‚ÄúHow it works‚Äù section of the profile.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Tip:</p>
      <p>Every Mentore mentor feels it is their responsibility to achieve your dreams. And to do that, transactional relations and a fixed number of interactions are not enough. So when you gauge the mentors, we recommend not just using session count as a definition of value. But rather use description, skills & trial sessions to select the mentor.</p>

    question:

      <p>This is the most common category of questions that we get.</p>
      <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
        <li>No matter who you‚Äôre -  a beginner, intermediate or advanced, there are hundreds of mistakes that you can possibly make on the path to success. It is very easy to get lost in resources and waste time doing wrong things or even doing it wrongly.</li>
